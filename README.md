# Overview

As a software engineer, one of my continuous learning goals is to familiarize myself with various programming languages. In this repository, I created a simple Kotlin program to demonstrate some of the key features of the language. The software is a simple console application that creates instances of 'Person' and 'Pet' classes, prints greetings, and iterates over lists to display elements. The main point of the excersize was to understand and demonstrate Kotlin syntax, class structure, loops, and the concept of data classes. I am sure there is more that can be done in the Kotlin language but this is just an ice breaker.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used IntelliJ IDE. It is an IDE widely used for Java and Kotlin development. The programming language for this software is Kotlin. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library. Kotlin is known for concise syntax and emphasis on safety. It is also widely used for app development in Android Studio.

# Future Work

- Include a section that is a more advanced Kotlin tutorial
- More complex hierarchies to demonstrate inheritance
- Create an application
